# sqlalchemy-challenge

Climate analysis and exploration uses Python and SQLAlchemy. 

Precipitation Analysis charts data set from 2017-08-23 to 2016-08-24. 'date' and 'prcp' are shown as a bar chart. Though, chart is not relatively visible due to amount of dates included. Would like to view bar chart at a larger scale. 

Meanwhile, Station Analysis is a histogram of the last 12 months of temperature observation data for station, "USC00519281 WAIHEE 837.5, HI US". Chart is more visible. 

A Climate App is mostly complete. There are 6 routes - welcome page, precipitation, stations, tobs(temperature observation), start date input, and start and end date input. Any pointers or guidance to complete last 2 routes is much appreciated. Thanks!
